OSG User School Style Guide
===========================

This is a style guide for OSG User School pages intended for instructors.
For markdown conventions, please consult [this style guide](https://opensciencegrid.org/technology/documentation/style-guide/).

- Students should "log in to" a node, not "log on to"
- User prompts should be formatted like so:

    ```
    username@<HOST> $
    ```

    Where `<HOST>` is one of `learn`, `osg-learn`, or `training`.
